  \begin{abstract}
    I hated seeing publications of Anons, Whisteblower, and internet users just written down as it was written on an Model 5150. Although, it is nice for nostalgia the addition of sources, images and comments directly in text is not nice to read.\\
    \indent Thefore, I decided to provide a small tempalte which is simple to use and easy on the eyes. Feel free to use it for everything you think is suitable.
